# Node-red-for-IoT-Prototyping

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its run-time in a single-click. Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the run-time in a single-click. JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using a rich text editor. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.

# Node-Red Exercises
These exercises are a series of Node-red tasks intended to complement the overall content of learning functionalities of palettes of Node-red. They should only be done when instructed during the course of the curriculum.

When doing these exercises, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are not intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use Google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.

# How to us these Exercises
1. Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to fork a repo.
2. Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on cloning a repository.
3. Go to an exercise directory and open the flow in Node-red running on browser. 
4. For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work.
5. Use this to make sure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.
